const axios = require('axios');

// Set the API endpoint and game ID
const endpoint = 'https://lichess.org/api/board/game/{gameId}/move/{move}';
const gameId = 'YOUR_GAME_ID';
const move = 'YOUR_MOVE';

// Set your API token
const token = 'YOUR_API_TOKEN';

// Send the move to Lichess
axios.post(endpoint, {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
})
.then(response => {
    console.log(response.data);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
});

To get a Lichess API token, you'll need to create a personal access token on the Lichess website. You can do this by going to the **API Access Tokens** page in your Lichess account preferencesÂ³. On this page, you can generate a new personal access token and specify the permissions that you want to grant to the tokenÂ³.

Once you've generated your personal access token, you can use it to authenticate your API requests to Lichess. You'll need to include your API token in the `Authorization` header of your HTTP requests as a bearer tokenÂ³.

To start a new game on Lichess using their API, you can use the `challenge` API endpoint to create a challengeÂ². When you create a challenge, Lichess will return a response that includes the game ID for the new gameÂ³. You can then use this game ID to interact with the game using other API endpointsÂ³.

Here's an example of how you might create a challenge and get the game ID using the `axios` module in Node.js:

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

// Set the API endpoint
const endpoint = 'https://lichess.org/api/challenge/{username}';
const username = 'YOUR_OPPONENTS_USERNAME';

// Set your API token
const token = 'YOUR_API_TOKEN';

// Create a challenge
axios.post(endpoint, {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    }
})
.then(response => {
    // Get the game ID from the response
    const gameId = response.data.challenge.id;
    console.log(`Game ID: ${gameId}`);
})
.catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
});
```

This code sends a POST request to the Lichess `challenge` API endpoint with the specified username. You'll need to replace `{username}` with the Lichess username of the player that you want to challenge. You'll also need to set your Lichess API token in the `token` variable.

Once you've created the challenge, you can get the game ID from the `id` property of the `challenge` object in the response. You can then use this game ID to interact with the game using other API endpoints.

I hope this helps! ðŸ˜Š
